- Worked on understanding existing Deep learning and Image processing methods for face and skin detection to
extract remote PPG signal for monitoring cardiac health and early detection of cardiac arrhythmia

- Derived new threshold values for skin pixel identication of various skin tones from the Indian region giving
result as Structural Similarity Index score of 0.82 on SFA Dataset (Human Skin Image Database)

- Worked on collecting video dataset from people with various skin tones for testing our algorithims
