I am currently pursuing Master's in Robotics at [University of Michigan - Ann Arbor](https://robotics.umich.edu/). I have always been fascinated by the ability of humans to move intelligently. In Robotics, the areas of **Control and Navigation in complex dynamic environments** are of most interest to me. I am mainly interested in Human-Robot interaction, specially in the context of social navigation and strategies to enable robot to work in close proximity of humans. 


I did my undergrad from [Bits Pilani, K.K Birla Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) with B.E in Electronics and Instrumentation. During my Bachelor's thesis at [Biorobotics Lab, CMU](https://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php), I worked on control of a Hybrid Legged-Wheel Robot for carrying heavy loads on vertical environments. I also worked on 3D reconstruction and registration of Miami surfside collapse data using SFM techniques. I was advised by [Prof Howie Choset](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/) and [Prof Robin Murphy](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/profiles/rmurphy.html)

I previously worked as a Research Assistant at [CLeaR Lab](https://clear-nus.github.io/) in National University of Singapore under the guidance of [Prof Harold Soh](https://haroldsoh.com/) where I worked on the problem of social navigation using legged robots. I worked on demonstrating a Diffusion based global planner for staisfying LTL constraints on Unitree Go2 robot. I also worked on creating a simulation tool for autonomously creating scenarios and benchmarking social navigation algorithims using LLMs.  

During my undergraduate studies, I worked on implementing Model Predictive Control with feedback linearization on robot manipulators with [Dr. Rakesh Warier](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/rakeshw/profile). I also worked with [Dr. Amit Setia](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/amitsetia/profile) on Optimal control using B-splines for trajectory planning and obstacle avoidance.

I previously also worked at [Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-CEERI)](https://www.csircmc.res.in/ceeri), [Mercedez-Benz Research and Development India(MBRDI)](https://www.mbrdi.co.in/#/) and [Mowito Robotics](https://www.mowito.in/)
