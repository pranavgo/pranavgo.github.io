I graduated from [Bits Pilani, K.K Birla Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) B.E Electronics and Instrumentation. I have always been fascinated by the ability of humans to move intelligently. In Robotics, the areas of **Control and Multi-modal sensing** are of most interest to me. I am mainly interested in the intersection of smart sensing and Control to lend intelligent locomotion capablities to robots in diverse environments. 

I pursued my bachelor's thesis at [Biorobotics Lab, CMU](https://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php). I mainly worked on control of a Hybrid Legged-Wheel Robot for carrying heavy loads on vertical environments. I also worked on 3D reconstruction and registration of Miami surfside collapse data using SFM techniques. I was advised by [Prof Howie Choset](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/) and [Prof Robin Murphy](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/profiles/rmurphy.html)

I am currently working at [CLeaR Lab](https://clear-nus.github.io/) in National University of Singapore under the guidance of [Prof Harold Soh](https://haroldsoh.com/). I am working on the problem of social navigation using legged robots. I am currently working on navigation stratergies for robots to incorporate and predict social behaviour in crowded setting. 

During my undergraduate studies, I worked on implementing Model Predictive Control with feedback linearization on robot manipulators with [Dr. Rakesh Warier](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/rakeshw/profile). I also worked with [Dr. Amit Setia](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/amitsetia/profile) on Optimal control using B-splines for trajectory planning and obstacle avoidance.

I previously also worked at [Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-CEERI)](https://www.csircmc.res.in/ceeri), [Mercedez-Benz Research and Development India(MBRDI)](https://www.mbrdi.co.in/#/) and [Mowito Robotics](https://www.mowito.in/)
