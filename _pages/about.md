I am a pre-final year undergraduate student at [Bits Pilani, K.K Birla Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/). In Robotics, the areas of **Control Systems, Motion Planning, and state estimation** are of most interest to me. Planning and Control of complex systems such as legged robots, robot manipulators, and autonomous mobile robots to make them more robust and accessible excite me the most. I am also interested in combining learning-based methods with the traditional control approach.

I prevously worked with [Dr. Madan Kumar Lakshmanan](https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/madan-kumar-lakshmanan/) at [Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-CEERI)](https://www.csircmc.res.in/ceeri) on Skin detection for Video plethysmography (VPG). I worked at [Mowito Robotics](https://mowito.in/) as Robotics Software Engineering Intern in Summer 2021, where I worked on creating a synthetic data generation tool for training MASK-RCNN using Blender.

I am currently pursuing undergraduate research on implementing Model Predictive Control with feedback linearization on robot manipulators with [Dr. Rakesh Warier](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/rakeshw/profile). I also worked with [Dr. Amit Setia](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/amitsetia/profile) on Optimal control using B-splines for trajectory planning and obstacle avoidance.

I am currently the Teaching Head of [The Electronics and Robotics Club, Bits Goa](https://erc-bpgc.github.io/). I am also part of Nirmaan Organization, through which I educate underpriveleged students in Zari district of Goa.
