- Worked on implementation of Model Predictive Control on 2D robot Manipulator on MATLAB and Simulink.
- Worked on dynamic Modeling of Robotic systems using Euler-Lagrange Method and deriving Inverse and Forward Kinematics equations for a 2D manipulator and implemented using Simscape Multibody
- Comparing performance of different controllers like PID and MPC on 2D arm
