On Orbit Manipulation aimed at using robot arms for peforming MEV docking on the client side in geostationary orbit. The project was sponsored by Northrop Grumman USA and was lead by [Dr. Beau Pollard](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-people/beau-pollard/) and Prof Howie Choset.

I worked on Hardware in Loop Validation control for peg insertion using Universal Robot arms. I also worked on contact force estimation and impedance control.
