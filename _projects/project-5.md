Trotbot is a multipurpose robot, designed to serve autonomously in indoor environment. It can be used as follows: To deliver packages from one location to another in offices, construction sites etc. It can also be teleoperated to nearby locations using the camera feed. 

The robot will be able to autonomously navigate around obstacles and reach waypoints set in and around the environment with the use of onboard sensors and be able to detect it's location. Currently, we are trying to solve the localization problem of the robot using IMU and 2D Lidar we have. We are also trying to implement visual odometry as an alternative.
