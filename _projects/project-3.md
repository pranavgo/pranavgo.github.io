Project SpiderBot started in Feb 2020, is a hexapod with six independent legs, each with three degrees of freedom. One advantage of legged robots is that it can climb over obstacles larger than itself. Hexapod walking robots also benefit from a lower impact on the terrain and have greater mobility in surroundings.

The purpose of this robot is to make a multi terrain robot that can traverse through the most difficult terrains and study various walking gaits and controllers to find the optimum one for this kind of system.

Currently we are working on creating a control stack using ROS for conducting simulations in gazebo with the CAD model we created. We are also doing torque calculations and dynamic modeling to manufacture a basic prototype for testing our algorithims. Lastly, we are doing literatue survey on existing methods and libraries such as TOWR and CHAMP. 

**Role:** Control and Simulation
