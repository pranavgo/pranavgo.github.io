The paper introduces a new threshold based skin and face detection method for extracting remote PPG signals for monitoring cardiac health. The propsed threshold values for skin pixels are tailored for the various skin tone found in Indian subcontinent region. Our threshold values were able to give a SSIM score of 0.82 on SFA Dataset(Human skin image dataset).
